# names-dataset

A set of US Names from the last 130 years.

## Data source

The data can be found at the [US Official Social Security Website](http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html) with the data sliced by year and with additional info. What I wanted (and maybe you) is a list of possible names for US people.

## Rerun

The data is already available on the project at `names-dataset.txt`, but if you want to rerun the script just put the downloaded data at `names` folder and execute `parsenames.py`.
